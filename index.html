            The Cadillac Escalade is an exorbitantly gigantic frame SUV. In Russia, it is represented by two variants-short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase. Although to call this giant "short" language does not turn – the length of the "baby" 5,179 m with a wheelbase of 2.91 m. Despite the size, the Escalade rides perfectly-perfectly holds the lane, clearly obeys the steering wheel, enters turns perfectly, although he does not like them, especially at speed. Inside, you feel disconnected from reality – perfectly quiet, super luxurious, and time seems to have stopped. You go to yourself and do not notice that it took not 10 minutes, but a whole hour. The Cadillac Escalade is the quietest car in existence. All thanks to the unique windshield, active noise reduction system and triple sound insulation of the doors. Security at the Escalade is high. And you may not know what kind of airbags he has and how many of them there are. When you get in the car, you immediately feel so calm. Still, the frame structure is a guarantee of strength and reliability. The car has 3 rows of seats. With a wave of the hand, it can turn from a seven-seat minibus into a two-seat cargo station wagon with a 2760-liter trunk. About how the Cadillac Escalade goes, you can say in one word-it hovers over the road. The speed of 120, 130, 140 km / h is not felt – it seems that only some 90, only you are surprised how quickly the cars moving in your direction flash outside the window.
